.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBdune subst\fR [\fB\N'45'\N'45'build\N'45'info\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR]â€¦
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Substitute \fB%%ID%%\fR strings in source files, in a similar fashion to what topkg does in the default configuration\N'46'
.P
This command is only meant to be called when a user pins a package to its development version\N'46' Especially it replaces \fB%%VERSION%%\fR strings by the version obtained from the vcs\N'46' Currently only git is supported and the version is obtained from the output of:
.P
.nf
  $ git describe \N'45'\N'45'always \N'45'\N'45'dirty \N'45'\N'45'abbrev=7
.fi
.P
\fBdune subst\fR substitutes the variables that topkg substitutes with the default configuration:
.sp -1
.P
\N'45' \fB%%NAME%%\fR, the name of the project (from the dune\N'45'project file)
.sp -1
.P
\N'45' \fB%%VERSION%%\fR, output of \fBgit describe \N'45'\N'45'always \N'45'\N'45'dirty \N'45'\N'45'abbrev=7\fR
.sp -1
.P
\N'45' \fB%%VERSION_NUM%%\fR, same as \fB%%VERSION%%\fR but with a potential leading \N'39'v\N'39' or \N'39'V\N'39' dropped
.sp -1
.P
\N'45' \fB%%VCS_COMMIT_ID%%\fR, commit hash from the vcs

.sp -1
.P

\N'45' \fB%%PKG_REPO%%\fR, contents of the \fBrepo:\fR field from the opam file

In order to call \fBdune subst\fR when your package is pinned, add this line to the \fBbuild:\fR field of your opam file:
.P
.nf
  [dune "subst"] {pinned}
.fi
.P
Note that this command is meant to be called only from opam files and behaves a bit differently from other dune commands\N'46' In particular it doesn\N'39't try to detect the root and must be called from the root of the project\N'46'

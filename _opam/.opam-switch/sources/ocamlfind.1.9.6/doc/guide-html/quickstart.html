<h1>
Intro
</h1><p>
See the file INSTALL for instructions how to build and install
findlib.
</p><h1>
Findlib and the toploop
</h1><p>
For a number of platforms, OCaml can load bytecode-compiled
libraries dynamically. For these platforms, findlib is very simple to
use as explained in the following. For other platforms, see the paragraph
below about &quot;custom toploops&quot;.
</p><p>
After the toploop has been started, it is possible to load the special
findlib support&#58;<a name="textnote1" href="#footnote1">[1]</a>

<p><pre>
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.07

# #use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives&#58;
  #require &quot;package&quot;;;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  #predicates &quot;p,q,...&quot;;;   to set these predicates
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
  #thread;;                 to enable threads

- &#58; unit = ()
</pre></p>

You can now list the available packages&#58;

<p><pre>
# #list;;
bigarray            (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
camlp4              (version&#58; Camlp4 version 3.03 ALPHA)
dbm                 (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
dynlink             (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
findlib             (version&#58; 0.6)
graphics            (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
labltk              (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
netstring           (version&#58; 0.10)
num                 (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
stdlib              (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
str                 (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
threads             (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
unix                (version&#58; [distributed with Ocaml])
xstrp4              (version&#58; 1.1)
</pre></p>

and load packages by simply typing&#58;

<p><pre>
# #require &quot;netstring&quot;;;
Loading /opt/ocaml/lib/unix.cma
Loading /opt/ocaml/lib/str.cma
Loading /opt/ocaml/site-lib/netstring/netstring.cma
Loading /opt/ocaml/site-lib/netstring/netstring_top.cmo
</pre></p>

Findlib takes care to load packages that are required by loaded packages
first. For example, &quot;netstring&quot; uses &quot;unix&quot; and &quot;str&quot; internally, but you
do not need to load them because findlib does it for you. In this example
you can also see that findlib loads netstring_top.cmo containing printers
for the toploop.
</p><p>
You can also enable the Camlp4 parsers by simply typing

<p><pre>
# #camlp4o;;
Loading /opt/ocaml-3.03a/lib/camlp4/camlp4o.cma
        Camlp4 Parsing version 3.03 ALPHA
</pre></p>

for the standard syntax or

<p><pre>
# #camlp4r;;
Loading /opt/ocaml-3.03a/lib/camlp4/camlp4r.cma
        Camlp4 Parsing version 3.03 ALPHA
</pre></p>

for the revised syntax. (But you cannot switch between the syntaxes.)

</p><h1>
Custom Toploops
</h1><p>
For some platforms, OCaml does not implement loading external
libraries (e.g. Cygwin). One has to create a so-called custom toploop
that statically links with these libraries. Example&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o mytop -package findlib,unix -linkpkg
$ ./mytop
        Objective Caml version 3.07
 
# #use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives&#58;
  #require &quot;package&quot;;;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  #predicates &quot;p,q,...&quot;;;   to set these predicates
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
  #thread;;                 to enable threads

- &#58; unit = ()
</pre></p>

Now &quot;#require&quot; works for all libraries referring to the special &quot;unix&quot;
functions.

</p><h1>
Findlib and scripts
</h1><p>
The #require directive can also be used in scripts. Example&#58;

<p><pre>
#use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
#require &quot;netstring&quot;;;

open Cgi;;
...
</pre></p>

This makes it possible to write scripts that do not contain #directory
directives that are specific for certain installations.
</p><p>
For Unix environments, you can start scripts directly if you
apply the following trick&#58;

<p><pre>
#! /bin/sh
# (*
exec ocaml &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$&#64;&quot;
*) use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
#require &quot;netstring&quot;;;

open Cgi;;
...
</pre></p>

This works wherever OCaml is installed.
</p><h1>
Compiling programs
</h1><p>
Assumed you want to compile a program that uses the Netstring package.
Do it the following way&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package netstring -c myprogram.ml
</pre></p>

This way you do not need to add &quot;-I&quot; options to locate Netstring.
</p><p>
If you want to create an executable, do not forget to add the
-linkpkg switch&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -o myprogram -package netstring -linkpkg myprogram.cmo
</pre></p>

This switch causes that the mentioned packages are added to the resulting
executable.
</p><p>
If you want to include several packages, you can either add several
&quot;-package&quot; options, or you can enumerate the packages separated by commas&#58;
-package netstring,labltk.
</p><h1>
Camlp4
</h1><p>
If you add a -syntax option, the compiler will be told to parse the
source file using camlp4&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package netstring -syntax camlp4o -c myprogram.ml
</pre></p>

Use -syntax camlp4o for the standard syntax or -syntax camlp4r for the
revised syntax.
</p><p>
Additionally, you can mention packages that add new syntax features.
The package xstrp4 is an example of this&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package xstrp4,netstring -syntax camlp4o -c myprogram.ml
</pre></p>

Now you can use the $ notation that is implemented by xstrp4 in the
source file myprogram.ml.
</p><p>
Note that you can also invoke ocamldep from ocamlfind&#58;

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind ocamldep -package xstrp4 -syntax camlp4o *.ml *.mli &gt;.depend
</pre></p>

This enables the syntax extensions, too.
</p><h1>
ocamlbrowser
</h1><p>
Since findlib-0.7, it is also possible to start ocamlbrowser from
ocamlfind. For example,

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind browser -package xstrp4
</pre></p>

adds the correct path specification such that the modules contained in the
package xstrp4 are also displayed. With

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind browser -all
</pre></p>

all package are added to the path spec.

</p><h1>
The Makefile wizard
</h1><p>
There is a wizard that makes it very easy to write Makefiles. Call the
wizard by
<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind findlib/make_wizard
</pre></p>
(the wizard requires that the labltk library is available). A new window
pops up, and by very few clicks you can describe your own library. Finally,
a Makefile is written.

</p><h1>
There is no magic!
</h1><p>
Findlib is neither a patch of OCaml nor uses it internal features of
the OCaml programming environment. It is only a convention to install
software components in filesystem hierarchies, a library interpreting 
this convention, and some frontend applications making the library useable for
you.
</p><p>
One important consequence is that you can only refer to those
software components that have previously been installed in a way findlib
understands. This convention is beyond the scope of this QUICKSTART guide,
see the reference manual for details. You can always check whether findlib
accepts a component as &quot;findlib package&quot; by the command

<p><pre>
$ ocamlfind list
</pre></p>

(this is the same as the #list directive in the toploop). If the package
occurs in the list, it is found, otherwise not.

<dl>
<dt><a name="footnote1" href="#textnote1">[1]</a></dt>
<dd>In previous versions, #use &quot;findlib&quot; loaded the
library. However, this caused a name conflict for a certain type of
installation. Because of this, the name of the loader script has been changed
to &quot;topfind&quot;, but &quot;findlib&quot;, and &quot;ocamlfind&quot; (Debian) are also available
for backwards compatibility.

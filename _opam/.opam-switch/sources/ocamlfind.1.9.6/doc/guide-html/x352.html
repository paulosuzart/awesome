>Plugins are packages that can be loaded at runtime. Plugins are
intended as a mechanism for loading add-on code into
executables. Technically, there is some overlap with the concept of a
"shared library". Note, however, that there is no universal support
for plugins, as it is unimplemented on some platforms, and only
poorly on some others (including x86 in the 32 bit case). Also, there
must always be an explicit "load" statement in the loading executable.
You cannot link an executable directly against plugins.</P

>For bytecode there is no problem to load cma files at runtime.
For native-code, though, you need to convert cmxa files into cmxs
files first:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlopt -shared -linkall -o m.cmxs m.cmxa</PRE
><P
>As mentioned, be prepared that this command fails on platforms where
plugins are unavailable.</P
><P
>The cmxs files can then be referenced from META. We don't use
the "archive" variable in this case but "plugin":</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>plugin(byte) = "m.cma"
plugin(native) = "m.cmxs"</PRE
><P
>Before findlib-1.6, there was some half-official convention using the
"plugin" predicate. This is still supported, but deprecated:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>archive(byte) = "m.cma"
archive(native,plugin) = "m.cmxs"</PRE

>Load-time dependencies</A
></H2
><P
>Plugins can be, of course, be dependent on other
plugins. You run into a problem, though, when you make a plugin dependent
on a package that doesn't qualify as plugin (i.e. lacks the "plugin"
definition). In this case, the loader simply skips the dependency,
and you cannot load the plugin.</P
><P
>Because of this dependency issue, it is recommended to add the
"plugin" variable to all packages that are installed on a system,
because this does not only allow it to load all packages at runtime, but
also to use these packages as dependency of the actual plugin code.</P
><P
>That said, you just need to add a "requires" directive, e.g.

<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>requires = "pkg1"
plugin(byte) = "m.cma"
plugin(native) = "m.cmxs"</PRE

>Linking an executable that can load a plugin: An executable
must link the package "findlib.dynload". This does not only add
the loader, but also special initialization code to the executable:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlfind ocamlopt -o program -package findlib.dynload -linkpkg ...</PRE
><P
>In particular, this records the packages that are already included
into the executable (in-core packages). If a plugin is now dependent
on such a package, this is recognized, and the package is not loaded
(which would not work anyway).</P
><P
>Now, you can load a plugin "foo" with:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>Fl_dynload.load_packages ["foo"]</PRE
><P
>This loads the cma or cmxs files, and runs the initialization code
of all top-level definitions of the included modules.</P
><P
>Of course, you can also call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>load_packages</TT
> from
a library if "findlib.dynload" is a required package of the library
package.</P

>Fat plugins</A
></H2
><P
>Sometimes it is handy to create plugins that already include all
the required packages. The plugin acts more like a dynamically loadable
executable that already includes whatever it needs. You can create such
a "fat" plugin with:

<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlfind ocamlopt -shared -linkpkg -linkall -o m.cmxs -package p1,p2,p3 m.cmxa</PRE
>

In this case, the "requires" line in the META file should remain empty.</P
><P
>Note, however, that you cannot handle packages this way that are already
linked into the main program, because it is invalid to load a module that
is already part of the main executable. Let's assume that the executable
links in q1, q2, and q3. Then, you need to exclude these packages from the
plugin. The -dont-link option comes handy in this case:

<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlfind ocamlopt -shared -linkpkg -linkall -o m.cmxs -package p1,p2,p3 -dont-link q1,q2,q3 m.cmxa</PRE
>

This excludes q1,q2,q3 even if these packages occur as dependencies of
p1,p2,p3. In this case, though, you need to put q1,q2,q3 into the "requires"
field of META.</P

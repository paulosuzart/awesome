></H1
><P
>Especially for beginners, the findlib distribution includes a GUI to
create Makefiles.  As this is an optional feature, it must have been
selected when findlib was built (option -with-toolbox). To invoke the
GUI, run the command

<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>$ ocamlfind findlib/make_wizard</PRE
>

(Btw, this is the general syntax to run executables installed in
package directories.) The wizard starts, and allows you to describe
your project. When you save the result, not only a "Makefile" is
created, but also the file ".make-wizard" containing the state.
If you later start the wizard again, this file will be automatically
loaded, and you can modify your definition.</P
><P
>The wizard consists of seven (hopefully self-explanatory) pages
you can fill out. The basic idea is that the .ml, .mli, .mly, and .mll
files in the current directory are compiled to a .cma or .cmxa
archive, and that optionally executables are created from this archive
and from additional modules (main programs). This scheme can be both
used for libraries and application programs.</P
><P
>You can choose packages you want to use in your library or
program by clicking at them in a selection box.  The camlp4 syntax
parsers can be optionally enabled. The modules to be compiled can 
be picked from the current directory, they must be selected in the
right order, however.</P
><P
>The generated "Makefile" defines a number of logical targets
(like "all", "opt", etc) that are explained at the beginning of the
file. The file is fully commented, and not very difficult to understand.
Only traditional Makefile syntax is used, so it is expected that it
works for every version of the "make" utility.</P
><P
>When you build the project, the META file is created
dynamically.  If you do not like this, set the variable MAKE_META to
the empty string.  (It is a good idea to put such setting into a
second file, and enter the name of this file into the box "Local
extensions in" of the wizard, so you can generate the "Makefile" again
without overwriting your own modifications.  This second file can
override the setting in the generated "Makefile".)</P

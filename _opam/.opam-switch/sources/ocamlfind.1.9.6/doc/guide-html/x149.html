CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Beginning with OCaml 3.00, the compiler itself has an interesting feature
called "automatic linking" that makes the following mechanism superflous in
most cases. Automatic linking means that it is possible to store the linker
options into the cma or cmxa file such that the compiler itself knows which
options are necessary. Of course, the following mechanism still works, and it
is still helpful when conditional linking is required.</I
></SPAN
></P
><P
>OCaml has a C interface which means that C libraries can be linked in
and C functions can be declared as new language primitives. Using such
libraries requires special linker options. Some of the core libraries
distributed with OCaml are partly implemented in C and thus additional
libraries must be specified in the linking phase of the program.</P
><P
>For example, the "str" library providing regular expressions requires
to be linked as follows:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlc -o prog str.cma my_file1.cmo my_file2.cmo -cclib -lstr</PRE
><P
>The -cclib option passes the following argument directly to the
underlying C linker which has the effect that libstr.a is linked in,
too. The "-cclib -lstr" is directly associated with str.cma as the
latter simply cannot be used without the former. Assume you would
write a META file describing str. That "str.cma" should be linked in
as archive is clear; the "-cclib -lstr" can be specified in another
variable called "linkopts". The META file would look like:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>requires = ""
version = "str from ocaml 2.02"
archive(byte) = "str.cma"
archive(native) = "str.cmxa"
linkopts = "-cclib -lstr"</PRE
><P
>This has the effect that specifying -linkpkg in one of the compiler
frontends not only chooses one of the archive files, but also extracts
the necessary linker options from the META file. The above example can
also be compiled with:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ocamlfind ocamlc -o prog -package str -linkpkg my_file1.cmo my_file2.cmo</PRE
><P
>Most people will never write META files with "linkopts" settings. But
this feature is very useful at least for the core libraries such as
str. Because of this, the "findlib" distribution comes with META files
for the core libraries in order to hide the linker options. This
means that you can already use the packages "str", "dbm", "dynlink",
"graphics", "num", "threads", "unix", and "camltk", and that the
appropriate archives and linker options are automatically extracted.</P

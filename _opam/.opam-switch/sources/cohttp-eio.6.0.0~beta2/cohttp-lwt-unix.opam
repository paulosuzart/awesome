synopsis: "CoHTTP implementation for Unix and Windows using Lwt"
description: """
An implementation of an HTTP client and server using the Lwt
concurrency library. See the `Cohttp_lwt_unix` module for information
on how to use this.  The package also installs `cohttp-curl-lwt`
and a `cohttp-server-lwt` binaries for quick uses of a HTTP(S)
client and server respectively.

Although the name implies that this only works under Unix, it
should also be fine under Windows too.

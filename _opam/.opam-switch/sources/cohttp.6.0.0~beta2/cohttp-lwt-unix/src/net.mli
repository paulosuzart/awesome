(** [init ?ctx ?resolver ()] is a network context that is the same as the
    {!default_ctx}, but with either the connection handling or resolution module
    overridden with [ctx] or [resolver] respectively. This is useful to supply a
    {!Conduit_lwt_unix.resolver} with a custom source network interface, or a
    {!Resolver_lwt.t} with a different name resolution strategy (for instance to
    override a hostname to point it to a Unix domain socket). *)

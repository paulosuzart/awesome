synopsis: "CoHTTP implementation using the Lwt concurrency library"
description: """
This is a portable implementation of HTTP that uses the Lwt concurrency library
to multiplex IO.  It implements as much of the logic in an OS-independent way
as possible, so that more specialised modules can be tailored for different
targets.  For example, you can install `cohttp-lwt-unix` or `cohttp-lwt-jsoo`
for a Unix or JavaScript backend, or `cohttp-mirage` for the MirageOS unikernel
version of the library. All of these implementations share the same IO logic
from this module."""

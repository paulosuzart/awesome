Aliases
=======

:term:`Aliases <alias>` are build targets that do not correspond to specific
files. For example, the ``runtest`` alias corresponds to running tests.

Model and Syntax
----------------

Dependencies and actions can be attached to an alias. When this alias is
requested to be built, these dependencies are built and these actions are
executed. Aliases are attached to specific directories.

In commands such as ``dune build``, the syntax to refer to the ``x`` alias is
``@x``, for example ``dune build @x``. This is why it is common to refer to it
as "the ``@x`` alias", or "attaching a rule to ``@x``".

Building ``@x`` will build ``x`` in all subdirectories of the current
directory. This is the most common case, but it is possible to restrict this
using different syntaxes:

- ``@sub/dir/x`` will build ``x`` in ``sub/dir`` and its subdirectories.
- ``@@x`` will build ``x`` in the current directory only.
- ``@@sub/dir/x`` will build ``x`` in ``sub/dir`` only.

If ``dir`` is the directory of a :term:`build context`, it restricts the alias
to this context.

To summarize, the syntax is:

- ``@`` (recursive) or ``@@`` (non-recursive): determine if subdirectories are
  included
- optional :term:`build context root`: restrict to a particular :term:`build
  context`
- optional directory: only consider this subdirectory
- alias name

Examples:

- ``dune build @_build/foo/runtest`` only runs the tests for
  the ``foo`` build context
- ``dune build @runtest`` will run the tests for all build contexts

User-Defined Aliases
--------------------

It is possible to use any name for alias names; it will then be available on
the command line. For example, if a Dune file contains the following, then
``dune build @deploy`` will execute that command.

.. code:: dune

   (rule
    (alias deploy)
    (action ./run-deployer.exe))

Built-In Aliases
----------------

Some aliases are defined and managed by Dune itself.

@all
^^^^

This alias corresponds to every known file target in a directory.

@check
^^^^^^

This alias corresponds to the set of targets necessary for development tools to
work correctly. For example, it will build ``*.cmi``, ``*.cmt``, and ``*.cmti``
files so that Merlin and ``ocaml-lsp-server`` can be used in the project.
It is also useful in the development loop because it will catch compilation
errors without executing expensive operations such as linking executables.

.. _default-alias:

@default
^^^^^^^^

This alias corresponds to the default argument for ``dune build``: ``dune
build`` is equivalent to ``dune build @@default``. Similarly, ``dune build
dir`` is equivalent to ``dune build @@dir/default``.

When a directory doesn't explicitly define what the ``default`` alias means via
an :doc:`dune/alias` stanza, the following implicit definition is
assumed:

.. code:: dune

   (alias
    (name default)
    (deps (alias_rec all)))

But if such a stanza is present in the ``dune`` file in a directory, it will be
used instead. For example, if the following is present in ``tests/dune``,
``dune build tests`` will run tests there:

.. code:: dune

   (alias
    (name default)
    (deps (alias_rec runtest)))

@doc
^^^^

This alias builds documentation for public libraries as HTML pages.

@doc-json
^^^^^^^^^

This alias builds documentation for public libraries as JSON files. These are
produced by ``odoc``'s option ``--as-json`` and can be consumed by external
tools.

@doc-private
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This alias builds documentation for all libraries, both public & private.

@fmt
^^^^

This alias is used by formatting rules: when it is built, code formatters will
be executed (using :doc:`promotion <../concepts/promotion>`).

``dune fmt`` is a shortcut for ``dune build @fmt --auto-promote``.

It is possible to build on top of this convention. If some actions are manually
attached to the ``fmt`` alias, they will be executed by ``dune fmt``.

Example:

.. code:: dune

   (rule
    (with-stdout-to
     data.json.formatted
     (run jq . %{dep:data.json})))

   (rule
    (alias fmt)
    (action
     (diff data.json data.json.formatted)))

@install
^^^^^^^^

This alias depends on the ``*.install`` files used by the :doc:`opam
integration <../explanation/opam-integration>`. In turn, these depend on
installable files.

@lint
^^^^^

This alias runs linting tools.

@runtest
^^^^^^^^

Actions that run tests are attached to this alias. For example this convention
is used by the ``(test)`` stanza.

``dune runtest`` is a shortcut for ``dune build @runtest``.

terminal-persistence
--------------------

Specifies how Dune handles the terminal when a rebuild is triggered in watch mode.

.. code:: dune

    (terminal-persistence <setting>)

where ``<setting>`` is one of:

- ``preserve`` does not clear the terminal screen between rebuilds.

- ``clear-on-rebuild`` clears the terminal screen between rebuilds.

- ``clear-on-rebuild-and-flush-history`` clears the terminal between rebuilds, and
  it also deletes everything in the scrollback buffer.

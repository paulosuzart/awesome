dune
====

``dune`` files are the main part of Dune. They are used to describe libraries,
executables, tests, and everything Dune needs to know about.

The syntax of ``dune`` files is described in
:doc:`/reference/lexical-conventions`.

``dune`` files are composed of stanzas, as shown below:

.. code:: dune

    (library
     (name mylib)
     (libraries base lwt))

    (rule
     (target foo.ml)
     (deps   generator/gen.exe)
     (action (run %{deps} -o %{target})))

The following pages describe the available stanzas and their meanings.

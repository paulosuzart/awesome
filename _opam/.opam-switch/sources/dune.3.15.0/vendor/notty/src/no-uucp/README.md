Cannibalized bits of Uucp:

- `Notty_uucp_data` is generated from an actual Uucp installation.
- `Notty_uucp` uses it to provide the few Unicode properties that Notty needs.
- `Notty_grapheme_cluster` is `Grapheme_cluster` from Uuseg, adapted to use the
  above.

Compiled size of these is on the order of 70K. Uucp is presently a monolithic 10M.

The idea is to remove these in favor of the actual Uucp/Uuseg, as soon as it
becomes possible to depend only on the necessary parts of Uucp.

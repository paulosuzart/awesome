(** serialisers to and from {!Macaddr} and s-expression {!Sexplib0} format

    To use these with ppx-based derivers, simply replace the reference to the
    {!Macaddr} type definition with {!Macaddr_sexp} instead. That will import
    the sexp-conversion functions, and the actual type definitions are simply
    aliases to the corresponding type within {!Ipaddr}. For example, you might
    do:

    {[
      type t = { ip : Ipaddr_sexp.t; mac : Macaddr_sexp.t } [@@deriving sexp]
    ]}

    The actual types of the records will be aliases to the main library types,
    and there will be two new functions available as converters.

    {[
      type t = { ip : Ipaddr.t; mac : Macaddr.t }

      val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexplib0.t
      val t_of_sexp : Sexplib0.t -> t
    ]} *)

type t = Macaddr.t

val sexp_of_t : Macaddr.t -> Sexplib0.Sexp.t
val t_of_sexp : Sexplib0.Sexp.t -> Macaddr.t
val compare : Macaddr.t -> Macaddr.t -> int

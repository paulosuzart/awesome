{0 Ptime {%html: <span class="version">v1.1.0</span>%}}

{!Ptime} has platform independent support for POSIX time. It provides
a {{!Ptime.t}type} to represent a well-defined range of POSIX
timestamps with picosecond precision, conversion with
{{!Ptime.date_time}date-time values}, conversion with
{{!Ptime.rfc3339}RFC 3339 timestamps} and {{!Ptime.print}pretty
printing} to a human-readable, locale-independent
representation. {!Ptime} is not a calendar library.

{!Ptime_clock} provides access to a
{{!Ptime_clock.platform_support}system POSIX clock} and the system's
current time zone offset.

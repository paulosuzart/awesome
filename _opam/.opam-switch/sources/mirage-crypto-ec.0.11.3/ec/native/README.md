# Generated code from fiat

This directory includes several files ("p*.h") that are generated by
[fiat](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto). The GNUmakefile provides
targets to generate these files.

The file "inversion_template.h" is copied from the fiat-crypto repository
at e31a36d5f1b20134e67ccc5339d88f0ff3cb0f86 (inversion-c/inversion_template.c),
and has some modifications: the "inversion" function is declared "static",
and the convenience function "inversion" is provided.

The "*_stubs.c" files are handcrafted.

The "p*_tables_32/64.c" are generated from `../gen_tables` (see each file's
header) and contain pre-computed data to speed up scalar multiplication for
ECDSA. The 64- and 32-bit tables must be respectively generated from a 64-bit or
32-bit build of `gen_tables`.

# Code from BoringSSL

The code in "curve25519_tables.h", and large parts of
"curve25519_stubs.c" and "point_operations.h" (excluding scalar multiplication)
originate from BoringSSL. Minor adjustments have been done manually.

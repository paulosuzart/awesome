Profiling Dune
==============

.. TODO(diataxis)
   - reference: the CLI
   - howto: profiling a dune build

If ``--trace-file FILE`` is passed, Dune will write detailed data about internal
operations, such as the timing of commands that Dune runs.

The format is compatible with `Catapult trace-viewer`_. In particular, these
files can be loaded into Chromium's ``chrome://tracing``. Note that the exact
format is subject to change between versions.

Specify the amount of Duneâ€™s verbosity.

.. code:: dune

    (display <setting>)

where ``<setting>`` is one of:

- ``progress``, Dune shows and updates a status line as build goals are being
  completed. This is the default value.

- ``verbose`` prints the full command lines of programs being executed by Dune,
  with some colors to help differentiate programs.

- ``short`` prints a line for each program executed with the binary name on the
  left and the targets of the action on the right.

- ``quiet`` only display errors.

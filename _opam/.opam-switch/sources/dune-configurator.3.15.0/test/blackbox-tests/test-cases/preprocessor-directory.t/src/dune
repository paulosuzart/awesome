; An executable which invokes a rewriter to exercise the logic for choosing the
; directory in which to invoke the rewriter. This project has two files named
; "rewrite.sh". One next to this dune file, and one in the project root. This
; project is designed to work in both the case where the rewriter is invoked
; from the project root (the behaviour in dune <= 3.7) and from the directory
; containing the dune file that specifies the preprocessing logic.

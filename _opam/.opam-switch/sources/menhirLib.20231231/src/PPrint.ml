(* The library pprint, which is found in the subdirectory pprint/, has been
   renamed vendored_pprint so as to prevent Dune from complaining about
   a conflict with a copy of pprint that might be installed on the user's
   system. *)

(* As a result, the library is now accessible under the name Vendored_pprint.
   Because we do not want to pollute Menhir's sources with this name, we
   define the module PPrint as an alias for Vendored_pprint. *)

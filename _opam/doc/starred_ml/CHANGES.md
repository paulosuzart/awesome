## 0.0.2

Includes pagination and total language count. See the template.

## 0.0.1

The very initial release of `Starred_ml`. This version is intended to help setting up CI but it is working already.

**IMPORTANT** This release won't use pagination on Github API, fetching only the first page of the starred items.

  (** These are OCaml bindings for Google's re2 library.  Quoting from the re2 homepage:

      {v
RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++ library.

Unlike most automata-based engines, RE2 implements almost all the common Perl and
PCRE features and syntactic sugars. It also finds the leftmost-first match, the
same match that Perl would, and can return submatch information. The one
significant exception is that RE2 drops support for backreferencesÂ¹ and
generalized zero-width assertions, because they cannot be implemented
efficiently. The syntax page gives full details. v}

      Syntax reference: {:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax}

  (** Although OCaml strings and C++ strings may legally have internal null bytes, this
      library doesn't handle them correctly by doing conversions via C strings.
      The failure mode is the search stops early, which isn't bad considering how rare
      internal null bytes are in practice.

      The strings are considered according to [Options.encoding] which is UTF-8 by
      default (the alternative is ISO 8859-1).

  (** Subpatterns are referenced by name if labelled with the [/(?P<...>...)/] syntax, or
      else by counting open-parens, with subpattern zero referring to the whole regex. *)

    | `Name of string
    ]

  (** [index_of_id t id] resolves subpattern names and indices into indices. **)
  val index_of_id_exn : t -> id_t -> int

  (** The [sub] keyword argument means, omit location information for subpatterns with
      index greater than [sub].

      Subpatterns are indexed by the number of opening parentheses preceding them:

      [~sub:(`Index 0)]  : only the whole match
      [~sub:(`Index 1)]  : the whole match and the first submatch, etc.

      If you only care whether the pattern does match, you can request no location
      information at all by passing [~sub:(`Index -1)].

      With one exception, I quote from re2.h:443,

      {v
Don't ask for more match information than you will use:
runs much faster with nmatch == 1 than nmatch > 1, and
runs even faster if nmatch == 0. v}

      For [sub > 1], re2 executes in three steps:
      1. run a DFA over the entire input to get the end of the whole match
      2. run a DFA backward from the end position to get the start position
      3. run an NFA from the match start to match end to extract submatches
      [sub == 1] lets it stop after (2) and [sub == 0] lets it stop after (1).
      (See re2.cc:692 or so.)

      The one exception is for the functions [get_matches], [replace], and
      [Iterator.next]: Since they must iterate correctly through the whole string, they
      need at least the whole match (subpattern 0).  These functions will silently rewrite
      [~sub] to be non-negative.

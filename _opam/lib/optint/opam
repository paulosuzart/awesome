synopsis:     "Efficient integer types on 64-bit architectures"
description: """
This library provides two new integer types, `Optint.t` and `Int63.t`, which
guarantee efficient representation on 64-bit architectures and provide a
best-effort boxed representation on 32-bit architectures.

Implementation depends on target architecture.

description: """
A sequence is an object holding a list of elements which support
the following operations:

- adding an element to the left or the right in time and space O(1)
- taking an element from the left or the right in time and space O(1)
- removing a previously added element from a sequence in time and space O(1)
- removing an element while the sequence is being transversed.

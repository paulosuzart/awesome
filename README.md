> My curated list of Github starts! Geberated by [starred_ml](https://github.com/paulosuzart/starred_ml)

This is also a repository template to be used with [starred_ml](https://github.com/paulosuzart/starred_ml). It includes:
  - A scheduled Github Actions to create a pull request with changes to README.md
  - [starred_ml](https://github.com/paulosuzart/starred_ml) installation with underlying required Ocaml stuff.

Have fun!
